                <h1 class="container-center">6 Tips to Make Your Computer More Secure</h1>
                
                <img class="hero-img center blog" src="tips.jpg">
                <h1>1. Do you need to be connected to the internet all the time?</h1>
                <p>If you have a computer running for long periods of time and you don’t need to be connected to the internet, then it’s probably quite prudent to switch your internet router off. Hackers tend to prefer to exploit “always on” connections, and if your internet connection is more irregular, you’ll be less attractive to them.</p>
                <h1>2. Be careful what you click!</h1>
                <p>The problem is, that there are sites out there that are out to get you. They may have been affected by a worm that modifies the website with the intention to infect your computer with a virus. Some sites are there to deliberately get you. Things are a little better these days, but there are still plenty of cases of infected sites.  Be careful where you’re browsing- and again make sure you’re anti-virus software is up to date.</p>
                <h1>3. Avoid Phishing scams - beware of suspicious emails and phone calls</h1>
                <p>Phishing scams are a constant threat - using various social engineering ploys, cyber-criminals will attempt to trick you into divulging personal information such as your login ID and password, banking or credit card information.<br>

                Phishing scams can be carried out by phone, text, or through social networking sites - but most commonly by email.
                Be suspicious of any official-looking email message or phone call that asks for personal or financial information.</p>
                <h1>4. Keep software up-to-date</h1>
                <p>Installing software updates for your operating system and programs is critical. Always install the latest security updates for your devices: <br>

                 1. Turn on Automatic Updates for your operating system.<br>
                 2. Use web browsers such as Chrome or Firefox that receive frequent, automatic security updates.<br>
                 3. Make sure to keep browser plug-ins (Flash, Java, etc.) up-to-date.</p>
                <h1>5. Use a VPN</h1>
                <p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is an excellent way to step up your security, especially when browsing online. While using a VPN, all of your internet traffic is encrypted and tunneled through an intermediary server in a separate location. This masks your IP, replacing it with a different one, so that your ISP can no longer monitor your activity.<br>
                    When it comes to choosing a provider, there are some okay free offerings out there, but monthly rates for paid services can be pretty low, even as little at $3 per month. The free ones are typically limited in features but can be good for getting a feel for what’s available. Some paid options have free trial periods for the full service and most offer generous money-back guarantee periods.
                </p>
                <h1>6. Don’t Trust Public Wifi</h1>
                <p>Did you know that much of your internet connection (web browsing and email) is being sent over the connection unencrypted? Anyone malicious in the coffee shop could be listening in and stealing your passwords. If you have a 3G connection then use that, but if not, you’ll need to secure your connection. Websites that use https (Facebook and Twitter for example) encrypt your data, but most websites won’t. For this, you’ll need to use a VPN or virtual private network. This encrypts your connection by connecting to a secure server in the middle</p>
